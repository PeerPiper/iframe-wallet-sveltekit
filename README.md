# iFrame Web3 Wallet Svelte Front End

This Svelte front end imports [https://github.com/PeerPiper/iframe-wallet-engine](https://github.com/PeerPiper/iframe-wallet-engine) and then allows users to interact with the wallet engine.

# Dev Notes

A step is added during the build phase to remove svelte development codeas a workaround. If the package manager version is used (github or npm) this step is not necessary.
